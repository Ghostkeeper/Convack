/* This is a typical example of how to pack a number of convex polygons in a
scene and get the results. This example involves the following steps:
- Prepare a number of convex polygons to pack. In this case we're going to pack
  the regular polygons between 3 and 10 vertices.
- Instruct Convack to pack these polygons tightly around the 0,0 coordinate.
- Read out the resulting convex polygons.
- Write the result to an SVG file. */
